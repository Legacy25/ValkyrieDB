# Test Bench

This will eventually contain all of the automated testing setup we will use to evaluate ValkyrieDB.

# time.py

Used to measure the runnning time of TPC-H queries in the ```sql``` folder on the various DBs. Currently its just Sqlite3 and the MushroomCloud 562 implementation modulo indexing.

# Future work

More scripts will be added here eventually, related to automated plotting, generating TPC-H, maybe even cloning other projects and bringing them into scope for the other tests to run.
